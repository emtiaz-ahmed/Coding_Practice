# Find nth Magic Number
# A magic number is defined as a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5. First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.
# Write a function to find the nth Magic number.

# Input: n = 2
# Output: 25

# Input: n = 5
# Output: 130 


# If we notice carefully the magic numbers can be represented as 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110 etc, where 001 is 0*pow(5,3) + 0*pow(5,2) + 1*pow(5,1). So basically we need to add powers of 5 for each bit set in given integer n.

# Below is the implementation based on this idea.

def findMagicNumber(n):
  result = 0
  power = 1

  while (n):
    power = power * 5

    # If last bit of n is 1
    if (n & 1):
      result += power
    ## each time n will take the next bit
    n >>= 1
  print(result)

findMagicNumber(6)
